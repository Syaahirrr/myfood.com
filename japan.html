<I>Sushi (寿司 or 鮨) is the most famous Japanese dish outside of Japan, and one of the most popular dishes among the Japanese.
In Japan, sushi is usually enjoyed on special occasions, such as a celebration.
<br>
<p>
Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish made of vinegared rice (sushi-meshi), typically with some sugar and salt, and a variety of toppings (neta), including frequently raw seafood and vegetables.
Sushi rice, also known as shari or sumeshi, is a crucial component of all sushi preparation methods and presentation styles.
<br>
<p>
Although brown rice or short-grain rice can also be used to prepare sushi, medium-grain white rice is the traditional ingredient.
It is frequently made with seafood, including imitation crab meat, squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, and tuna.
Sushi comes in many vegetarian varieties.
Wasabi, soy sauce, and pickled ginger (gari) are frequently added to the dish.
Popular toppings for the dish include pickled daikon (takuan) or daikon radish.
<br>
<p>
Sushi is typically served on minimalist, geometric, mono- or duo-tone wooden or lacquer plates that reflect the aesthetics of this cuisine.
Sushi may be served kaiten zushi (sushi train) style, in which diners select their favorite sushi from a conveyor belt of colored plates.
After finishing, the number of plates of each color taken is added up to determine the final bill.
To track the amount of time that has passed since a dish was prepared, more recent kaiten zushi restaurants embed barcodes or RFID tags in the food.
<br>
<p>
Sashimi, a dish similar to sushi in Japanese cuisine that is made up of thinly sliced raw fish or occasionally meat, is occasionally confused with sushi.
