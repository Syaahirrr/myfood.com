Everyone knows what food is, but do they know what it means?
<br>
<p>
Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body.
It is usually of plant or animal origin and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals.
The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells in an effort to produce energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.
Historically, people secured food through two methods: hunting and gathering, and agriculture.
Today, most of the food energy consumed by the world population is supplied by the food industry.
