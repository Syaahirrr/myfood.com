<p>
<I>In English, the word "döner" refers to the motion of rolling.
When you visit a Döner Kebab restaurant, you will quickly notice that the chef or the roaster itself slowly rolls the cone-shaped stack of meat.
This slow-rolling motion helps to keep as much of the meat's juice inside as possible while allowing the outer layers of the stacked meat to cook out evenly.
<br>
<p>
It is made from seasoned veal leg meat slices that are stacked and cooked on a rotating vertical rotisserie.
It is one of the most well-known kebab varieties in Turkish cuisine.
It is a forerunner of the Greek gyro and the Arabic shawarma.
<br>
<p>
In Berlin in the 1960s, Turkish immigrants created and popularised the modern döner kebab sandwich.
In 2011, the Association of Turkish Doner Manufacturers in Europe, based in Berlin, acknowledged this.
Berlin currently has more döner kebab shops than Istanbul.
<br>
<p>
A doner kebab's sliced meat may be served on a plate with various sides, sandwiched between two pieces of bread (pita or another), or wrapped in a thin flatbread (dürüm) like lavash or yufka (literally meaning roll or wrap in Turkish).
Early in the 1970s, Kadir Nurman invented the sandwich or wrap, which has since gained popularity as a fast food item sold by kebab shops and is frequently referred to as a "kebab."
A salad or vegetables, such as tomato, lettuce, cabbage, onion with sumac, fresh or pickled cucumber, chili, and different types of sauces, are typically included in a sandwich.</I>
