<p><I>Since the sixteenth century, pizza has been a pillar of Italian heritage and culture. From there, it spread throughout the entire world, where it was interpreted, used, and embraced by almost everyone.
<br>
<p>But what does authentic Italian pizza actually taste like?
<br>
<p>What characteristics lend it to being the renowned and delectable cuisine that we all know and adore?
<br>
<p>Here's what it really feels like to enjoy a delicious slice of pizza in Italy.</I>
<br>

<p><I>First of all, you will notice that Italian pizzas are typically served as a whole pie rather than a slice whether you are sitting by the sea in Sicily, taking in the Tuscan countryside, or watching the twinkling lights of the Colosseum as night falls.
One of the most common misconceptions about Italian pizza is that it is typically served in a deep dish like a thick cake.
In actuality, the crust, which is typically thin but fluffy, is one of the meal`s most crucial ingredients.
The distinctive flavor and exceptional texture that can only be found in Italian pizza can be found in the crust.
<br>
<p>
The sauce, which is the next crucial element, is typically made from local Italian tomatoes that have been carefully grown in rich Italian soil and peeled, most frequently San Marzano.
Another strange thing about this sauce is that it is not cooked with the other toppings; rather, it is left fresh and chilled on top of the crust.
Some varieties of Italian pizza, known as Bianca, are served completely without sauce and are instead drizzled with olive oil.
Pizzas are frequently finished with a scattering of fragrant leafy basil and a delicate drizzle of olive oil to lend smooth uniformity.</I>
