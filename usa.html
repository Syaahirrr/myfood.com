<I>A hamburger (or burger) is a sandwich made from two halves of a sliced bun and a cooked ground meat patty, typically beef.
Hamburgers are frequently served with a variety of toppings, including mayonnaise, dill relish, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and cheese.
<br>
<p>
You can either add condiments to your hamburger or order them on the side. Mustard, mayonnaise, and ketchup are the three most popular condiments.
However, barbecue sauce and salad dressings are also widely used.
On its renowned Big Mac hamburger, McDonald's uses its own "Big Mac sauce".
The Heinz 57 sauce is well-liked by burger fans.
<br>
<p>
Other popular toppings include bacon, avocado, or guacamole, sliced sautéed mushrooms, sliced sauce, and/or chili (usually without beans).
Somewhat less common toppings include fried egg, scrambled egg, feta cheese, salsa, pineapple, Jalapeños and other varieties of chile peppers, anchovies, slices of ham or bologna, pastrami, or teriyaki-seasoned beef, tartar sauce, french fries, onion rings, or potato chips.
<br>
<p>
Hamburgers are usually a feature of fast food restaurants. The majority of the time, major fast food chains use frozen hamburgers that have been mass-produced in factories.
In contrast to the traditional American hamburger made in homes and traditional restaurants, which is thicker and made by hand from ground beef, these hamburgers are thin and of uniform thickness.
The majority of hamburgers in America are rounded, but some fast-food restaurants, like Wendy's, offer square-cut versions.
Fast food establishments typically grill hamburgers on a flat top, but some businesses, like Burger King, employ a gas flame grilling technique.</I>
