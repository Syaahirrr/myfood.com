<I>Rice that has been cooked in coconut milk and pandan leaf is the main component of the Malay dish nasi lemak. In Malaysia, where it is revered as the national dish, it is frequently encountered.
Additionally, it is a traditional dish in nearby regions with sizable Malay populations, including Singapore, Brunei, and Southern Thailand.
It is present in several areas of Sumatra in Indonesia, particularly in the Malay regions of Riau, the Riau Islands, and Medan.
<br>
<p>
Additionally, nasi lemak is served in Australia's overseas territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, as well as the Bangsamoro region of Mindanao, where it is prepared by Filipino Moros.
It is regarded as a necessary component of a traditional Malay breakfast dish. Most of the nation's travel guides and promotional materials list nasi lemak as a national dish.
<br>
<p>
The Circumstances of Malay Life, a 1909 book by Sir Richard Olof Winstedt, made reference to nasi lemak. Its name, which has roots in Malay culture and cuisine and literally translates to "fatty rice," is understood in this context to mean "rich" or "creamy."
The name is derived from the method of preparation, which involves steaming a mixture of rice and coconut cream.
Typically, pandan leaves are used to cook the rice, giving it a distinct flavor.
<br>
<p>
Traditionally, nasi lemak is served with a hot, spicy sauce (sambal) and a variety of toppings, such as hard-boiled or fried eggs, fresh cucumber slices, tiny fried anchovies (ikan bilis), and roasted peanuts.
Nasi lemak can also be paired with another protein dish, such as ayam goreng (fried chicken), sambal sotong (cuttlefish in chili), small fried fish, cockles, or rendang daging, to make a more filling meal (beef stewed in coconut milk and spices).
Other accompaniments include the spicy pickled vegetable salad acar and stir-fried water convolvulus (kangkong). The majority of these condiments are typically spicy in nature.
<br>
<p>
In Malaysia and Singapore, nasi lemak is a popular dish to eat. It is typically sold at hawker centers and roadside stalls in Malaysia and Singapore and is more frequently eaten as breakfast in both nations.
Nasi lemak is a popular local breakfast food in Indonesia, especially in Eastern Sumatra (Riau Islands, Riau, and Jambi provinces). It is also a well-liked regional dish called "nasi gemuk" in Palembang.
"Gemuk" and "lemak" are equivalent in Palembang Malay. This unusual dish is frequently served on a plate or wrapped in banana leaves, newspaper, or brown paper.
<br>
<p>
However, because of its popularity, some restaurants offer it as a lunch or dinner option, allowing customers to eat the dish all day long.
Another name for nasi lemak served with steamed rice is "steamed nasi lemak," or "nasi lemak kukus." In Malaysia, a pasar malam (night market) with a variety of foods also sells nasi lemak.</I>
